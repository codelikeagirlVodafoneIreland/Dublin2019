<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<div>
<p>Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years).</p>
<h3>We live In A Greenhouse</h3>
<p>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of infrared heat. About 90 percent of this heat is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface, which is warmed to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).</p>
</div>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.</li>
  <li>Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concequences</h3>
<ul>
 <li>On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not</li>
 <li>Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.</li>
 <li>Meanwhile, some crops and other plants may respond favorably to increased atmospheric CO2, growing more vigorously and using water more efficiently. At the same time, higher temperatures and shifting climate patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and affect the makeup of natural plant communities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Household</b>Reduce the carbon intensity of your homes and your lifestyles. Evolve from unsustainable lifestyles that are individualistic and that value conspicuous consumption. See link on how to ‘Live Green’. See the United Nations Lazy Persons 3-Level guide to Living Sustainably. Level 1 - Sofa Superstar; Level 2 – Household Hero; and , Level 3 – Neighbourly Nice.</li>
<li><b>Buisness</b>Improve your resource efficiency throughout your enterprise. Know your carbon intensity and mitigate it.  Invest to become sustainably competitive and cease production of harmful or unsustainable goods and services.</li>
<li><b>Local Authorities and Agencies</b>Delivering public services in the most resource efficient manner.  Being a public good in leading the way and enabling sustainable communities through excellence in land-use and town planning, public transport, and the provision of appropriate supports.</li>
  <li><b>Schools</b>Education and knowledge are key to delivering change.  The predicted impacts of climate change in 2100 will be within the lifetime of todays children. </li>
  <li><b>Government</b>Put Climate Change and Sustainable Development at the centre of national policy development.  Strive for integrated policy development across departments and functions and avoid negative environmental externalities of poorly planned policy interventions. Eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies.  Take the long term view embracing multiple electoral cycles.  Plan, and most importantly, implement.  Governed people must be enabled and encouraged to make sustainable choices.  National and Departmental budgeting must provide appropriate finance to deliver on national Mitigation Plans and the National Adaptation Framework, and the State must support intergovernmental climate change processes, including international Climate Finance measures that aim to support developing countries to undertake mitigation and adaptation activities in the long term.</li>
